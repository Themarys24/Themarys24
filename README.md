## Hi there 👋 My name is Maria! 🍀 ´◡` 🍀

💡🚀Hello! I’m Maria Ferreira, a Computer Science student transitioning from Accounting to Technology.

Here, I share my learning journey with projects, developing hard skills alongside the soft skills I’ve gained throughout my life. 
Career transitions are challenging—it's not easy to step out of a comfort zone that you know so well and start learning a new profession from scratch. 
That’s why every new programming language I learn and every project I challenge myself to develop, is another brick I add to my ladder toward professional excellence, which I am always striving for!

"It’s never too late to start something new, and I truly believe technology is the future." 🌐 💻💡📚💬
