## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ’¡ğŸš€ I am transitioning from accounting to computer science. In parallel with college, I am taking courses to deepen my knowledge in Programming Languages, Data Structures, Web Development and Algorithms, to combine theory and practice.
My previous experience has given me skills such as time management, problem solving, team collaboration and discipline, which I now apply in this new journey. I am passionate about learning and building solutions that make a difference! ğŸ’»ğŸ’¡ğŸ“šğŸ’¬
